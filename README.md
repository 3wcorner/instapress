Don't install Instapress on your blog! It won't work at the moment! (09-26-2013)

Hello
-----

Here are some links:

* [http://instapress.it/](http://instapress.it/)
* [http://wordpress.org/plugins/instapress/](http://wordpress.org/plugins/instapress/)

Unfortunately this plugin needs many fixes and we don't have time to do them. 
We got the proposal to push the plugin on github - and here we are...

You're welcome to help and make the whole thing work again :)

FYI: Last update was ... puh... long ago - before Instagram got it's new API (that's one of the main reasons why it isn't working anymore)


Progress
--------

* Thanks to [https://github.com/AJ-Acevedo](AJ-Acevedo) the plugin is now working with PHP 5.4!

How you can help
----------------

At the moment the most important thing is to make the plugin work with the new Instagram API.
After that, Snippet properties and Plugin Settings should be tested (and fixed if necessary).

Well, and if everythings working again we can think of new features :)

Take a look at the full issue list and feel free to create new ones: [https://github.com/Liechtenecker/instapress/issues](Instapress Issues on GitHub)

Thank you!
